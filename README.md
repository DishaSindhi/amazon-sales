# Amazon Sales Analysis using SQL

##  Introduction

Amazon, one of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms, provides a wide variety of products across categories like electronics, fashion, furniture, food, and more. In this project, I performed **Sales Analysis using SQL** to extract meaningful insights from Amazon’s dataset.

The project focuses on solving key business queries such as identifying best-selling products, analyzing discounts, checking product reviews, and filtering customer sentiment using SQL queries.

##  Key SQL Queries & Insights

1. **List all products with a discounted price below ₹500**
   → Helps identify budget-friendly products.

2. **Find products with a discount percentage of 50% or more**
   → Useful for highlighting high-discount items.

3. **Retrieve products containing the word “Cable”**
   → Helps search products by keyword.

4. **Display the difference between average actual price & discounted price**
   → Measures the discount impact.

5. **Query reviews mentioning “Fast Charging”**
   → Captures customer feedback on fast-charging products.

6. **Identify products with a discount percentage between 20% and 40%**
   → Useful for promotional analysis.

7. **Find products above ₹1000 with 4+ rating**
   → Helps locate premium, high-rated products.

8. **Find products where discounted price ends with 9**
   → Analyzes pricing psychology (e.g., ₹999).

9. **Display negative reviews (worst, waste, poor, not good)**
   → Identifies dissatisfied customers.

10. **List products in the “Accessories” category**
    → Filters category-specific items.
